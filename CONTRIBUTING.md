# Branch Naming Conventions
To help keep consistent naming conventions, we ask that contributions are submitted in their own branch that
should be named to match the version of this library the contribution was originally branched from. For example,
to submit a contribution named foo to Version 0.3.0 of the package, you could create a branch titled v0.3.0-foo.
Following this practice will help the project maintainers when merging contributions into the library, we thank
you for your assistance!
